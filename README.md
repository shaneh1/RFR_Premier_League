# RFR_Premier_League
Random forest regression trees to predict the outcome of premier league football games. The program reads in data from book.csv, which contains results and statistics from all premier league football games since 2008. It calculates moving averages for home team goals, shots and shots on target and the same for away teams. These moving averages replace the initial statistics that come with the file. The independent variables are now moving averages for the previous 5 games for goals, shots and shots on target for both home and away teams, as well as the odds for a home win, draw and away win. The dependent variable is the full time result - Home Win (H), Draw (D) or Away Win (A). A random forest regression model is developed. The optimal number of trees to be grown was found to be 750, returning an accuracy of approximately ~56%. The results can be seen in a confusion matrix.
